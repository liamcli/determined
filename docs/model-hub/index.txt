 Overview
**********

Determined's **model-hub** library makes it easy to train models from
popular third-party libraries with a Determined cluster. With model-hub,
use trusted implemenations of model architectures, with Determined's
ability to scale training, track experiments, share resources and
perform hyperparameter searches.

Each supported third-party library in model-hub is accompanied by:

-  Official examples checked for correctness and thoroughly tested for
   use with Determined.
-  A base Determined Trial class with common functionality implemented
   for the user.
-  A prebuilt docker environment with all dependencies installed and
   versioned for reproducibility.
-  A suite of helper functions (if applicable) to allow users to easily
   write their own trial classes for use with the third-party library.

*****************
 Getting Started
*****************

For a given task, deep learning practioners often adapt existing model
implementations from a trusted third-party library, such as HuggingFace
Transformers. When beginning your deep learning project in this way, we
suggest using **model-hub** with the following these steps:

-  Check for a Model Hub library that supports model implementations for
   your task

-  If the Model Hub Library includes an official example fit for your
   task, copy, customize, and deploy it

-  If the Model Hub Library does not include example fit for your task,
   copy the base Determined Trial class and customize it

   For detailed instructions, check out the documentation for your Model
   Hub library of choice.

*********************
 Libraries Available
*********************

In this initial release, **model-hub** :ref:`supports
<model-hub-transformers>` the `Huggingface transformers library
<https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_.

Future libraries on our roadmap to include in model-hub include

-  `mmdetection <https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection>`_
-  `detectron2 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2>`_

If you have additional libraries you want to see supported in **model-hub**
please let us know by filing an issue on `GitHub
<https://github.com/determined-ai/determined>`_ or reaching out on `Slack
<https://join.slack.com/t/determined-community/shared_invite/zt-cnj7802v-KcVbaUrIzQOwmkmY7gP0Ew>`_

For next steps, learn more about **model-hub** :ref:`support for
transformers <model-hub-transformers>`!
