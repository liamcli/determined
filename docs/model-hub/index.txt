Determined's **model-hub** library makes it easy to use popular
third-party libraries with a Determined cluster. Each supported
third-party library in **model-hub** will be accompanied by:

-  Official examples checked for correctness and thoroughly tested for
   use with Determined.
-  A prebuilt docker environment with all dependencies installed and
   versioned for reproducibility.
-  A base Determined Trial class with common functionality implemented
   for the user.
-  A suite of helper functions (if applicable) to allow users to easily
   write their own trial classes for use with the third-party library.

In this initial release, **model-hub** :ref:`supports
<model-hub-transformers>` the `Huggingface transformers library
<https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_.

Future libraries on our roadmap to include in **model-hub** include

-  `mmdetection <https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection>`_
-  `detectron2 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2>`_

If you have additional libraries you want to see supported in
**model-hub** please let us know!

transformers <model-hub-transformers>`!
