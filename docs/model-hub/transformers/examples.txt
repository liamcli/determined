`Transformers examples
<https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`_ are
the starting point for many users of the `transformers
<https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_ library. Hence, they are
the core feature of **model-hub's** support for transformers library. In
fact, each `transformer example corresponding to a core transformer task
<https://huggingface.co/transformers/examples.html#the-big-table-of-tasks>`_
has an associated task in **model-hub** that is guaranteed to work with
Determined and verified for correctness. See the table below for a
summary of the **model-hub** transformers examples:

Each of the Determined trials above subclasses the
``BaseTransformerTrial`` and makes use of helper functions in
``model_hub.huggingface`` to drastically reduce the code needed to run
the example. See :ref:`the api <model-hub-transformers-api>` for more
details.
